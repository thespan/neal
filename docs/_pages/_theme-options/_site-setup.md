# Site Setup

If you want your site to work correctly, you need to do some basic setup. At first we'll create basic, must have pages, then we'll display them in Navigation Menu and then will set up **Front Page** and **Posts Page**.

## Create Pages

To create a new page, within your dashboard you should go to **Pages > Add New.** Enter page title and leave editor field empty, select page templates and hit Publish. Each page has its unique options which I'll discuss later on. The following templates should be used for following pages:

 - **Contact** - Contact Page
 - **Homepage** - Home Page

## Reading Settings

To determine which would be displayed as **Front Page** and which one as **Posts Page**, within your dashboard navigate to **Settings > Reading** and setup like on this picture below. Then click on **Save Changes** and basic site setup is done.

## Navigation Menu

Now, once we've created all necessary pages we should display them in Navigation Menu. Within your Dashboard go to **Appearance > Menus** and click on **Create Menu**

Menu Name ex: "Main Menu" and then assign Theme Locations: **Main Menu** After that click on **Save Menu** and you're done.
