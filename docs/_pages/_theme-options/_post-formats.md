Please note that Featured image is **REQUIRED** for all Post Formats, except **Gallery** and **Video** formats on **Blog.** Each post format has its unique options and when you change them from one to another you will notice that Post Format metabox options will change acordingly. Let me explain you these options one by one:

## Standard

This is default Post Format, which displayes Feutured Image and Post Content only.

## Gallery

This is a gallery of images, which will be displayed in a responsive image slider, powered by Owlslider You can add images via clicking **Add Image to Gallery** button which opens Add Media popup, then upload them from your local machine or load them from your media library. Also you can Add images, Remove to images or Drag and drop to change the location of images any time you want.

## Video

This format supports **Embed** and Self-hosted video types. For Video type: Embed you should copy-paste Video Embed Code (YouTube) in the given textarea, but for Video type: **Self-hosted** you should upload files in **.mp4** and **.ogv** formats, if you want your Video Post to be displayed in all browsers correctly.

**Video Type: Embed**

This format supports **Link Description,** **Link Title** (may be author) and actual **URL** fields. Note that **URL** will be attached only to the **Link Title.**

## Quote

This format is quite the same as Link, but it doesn't require additional **URL** field.
