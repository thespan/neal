## Troubleshooting

1. **"Are you sure you want to do this?"** error

	If you get the “Are You Sure You Want To Do This” message when installing minnosh.zip file via WordPress, it means you have an upload file size limit that is set by your host. If this happens, please install the theme via FTP or contact your hosting company and ask them to increase the limit.

1. **Theme is missing the style.css stylesheet** error

	A common issue that can occur when installing a WordPress themes is **“The package could not be installed. The theme is missing the style.css stylesheet.”** error message being displayed when uploading or activating the theme. One of the reasons you may receive this error is if you have uploaded the incorrect file. You have 2 options for downloading your theme

	- Installable WordPress file only
	- All files and documentation (full zip folder). You will need to extract and locate the installable WordPress file.
