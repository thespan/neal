## Troubleshooting

1. **I don't see Import Demo Data menu**

	Make sure that the Minnosh Demo Importer plugin is installed and activated.

1. **I stuck at the importing screen**

	Mostly, this issue comes from the hosting configuration. Please place a ticket on our [support system](http://uix.ticksy.com/). Our developer will help you check it.

1. **Demo content duplicated**

	When you import our demo content, it can take several minutes depending on the speed of your server. Each time the button is clicked it will import the content, so if it is clicked twice it will import everything two times. There are two ways to get rid of duplicate content.

	**Method 1**: WP Reset Plugin – This plugin is the fastest way to get rid of content. However, it will remove all content from your database and leave the default theme activated. It does not remove plugins, but will deactivate them and remove all pages, posts, menus, sliders, widget data, theme options, etc. Basically it removes all the content that you imported from our theme. Only do this if you are able to start over. [Click Here To Download](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-reset/).

	**Method 2**: Manual Removal – This method will take longer and simply involves manually removing duplicate items. For example, go to the **Appearance > Menu** and delete and duplicate items one by one. Same thing for pages, post, sliders, etc.
