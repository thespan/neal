# Install Plugins

After installing the Minnosh theme, you'll see a notification in the top of the page that says the theme needs some plugins to function properly.

## Required Plugins

Required plugins are very important and must be installed and activated at all times for Minnosh to work properly. The Minnosh theme **requires** following plugins

- [Minnosh Extension](http://thespan.ml/wordpress-themes/minnosh/): The core plugin of the theme.
- [Minnosh Demo Importer](http://thespan.ml/wordpress-themes/minnosh/): this plugin required to import demo content.

## Recommended Plugins

Recommended plugins which are plugins that we use in our demos and are fully integrated with Minnosh. You can choose not to install these plugins if youâ€™re not going to use them. The Minnosh theme **recommends** following plugins:

- [Envato Market](https://envato.github.io/wp-envato-market/): The Envato Market plugin lets you view your ThemeForest purchases within the WordPress dashboard and select whether or not to receive updates.

Minnosh is working perfectly with these plugins. It automatically adds more styles to them to make the design match the theme.

## Install These Plugins

**Step 1** - From the WordPress admin, navigate to the **Appearance > Install Plugins**. Here you'll find Minnosh's required and recommended plugins.

**Step 2** - Just click on **Install** below each plugin's name.

**Step 3** - After installing, if it's required to activate the plugin, just activate them.


## Troubleshooting

1. **Failed to install/activate some plugins.**

	Sometimes, the download process failed on some hostings and some files are not downloaded. Therefore, you can't active it. Please navigate to **Plugins > Installed Plugins** and delete those plugins. Then install them again.
