# Customize Theme With A Child Theme

A WordPress child theme allows you to apply custom code changes to your site. Using a child theme ensures that all your customizations will not be overwritten even when you update the parent theme.

Minnosh is fully child theme compatible. We have attached a basic child theme to the download package which contains the minimum of required files. If you are planing any code customizations we highly recommend to do this inside the child theme! Learn more about child themes [here](http://codex.wordpresss.org/Child_Themes).

!> **SUPPORT POLICY ON CHILD THEMES** - While child themes are a great way to add custom changes to Minnosh, there are generally used to customize core code from the parent theme. Because of this, please be aware that customizations of this nature fall outside our scope of support and we will be unable to assist you with issues that may arise from it.


### What Is A Child Theme?

A child theme is a theme that has all the functionality and styling of another theme called the parent theme, which in our case, is Minnosh. Child themes are the recommended way of modifying the code of an existing theme because a child theme preserves all custom code changes and modifications even after a theme update. If you modify code directly from a parent theme, then update the parent theme, your changes will be lost. Always use a child theme if you are modifying core code.

Child themes can also be used for a number of things, such as custom CSS applications, template file modifications, and custom PHP functions and/or hooks. There are a couple of methods to modify a child theme. Child themes donâ€™t guarantee that an update of custom code on the parent theme will not require further maintenance. This is especially true if you copy files from the parent theme to your child theme.
